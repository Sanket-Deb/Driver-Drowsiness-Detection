# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

This is a research based project on Driver Drowsiness Detection based on Machine Learning models using CNN, this was a group project carried under the supervision of a guide where we reviewed various methods of the Driver Drowsiness and implemented the same, we executed four models where we replicated 2 CNN models from papers previously published and then one custom architecture and one VGG19 model and compared the results of all these different models with our selected dataset.
