# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

This is a research based project on Driver Drowsiness Detection based on Machine Learning models using CNN, this was a group project carried under the supervision of a guide where we reviewed various methods of the Driver Drowsiness and implemented the same, we executed four models where we replicated 2 CNN models from papers previously published and then one custom architecture and one VGG19 model and compared the results of all these different models with our selected dataset.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the following dataset:
- **Yawn and Eye Dataset**: A dataset used for drowsiness detection.
  - Link: [Yawn and Eye Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new)

## Overview
- Implemented machine learning techniques to validate, split, and manipulate data for drowsiness detection, to increase model accuracy and robustness.
- Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to assess driver drowsiness by analyzing eye and mouth data. Enhanced driver drowsiness detection with a chosen dataset.
- Visualized the results to compare and contrast the models and proposed a multimodal deep learning system for adaptability.
